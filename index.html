<h1>Tech is for everyone</h1>
This website is meant to match students and underrepresented people in tech
with tech conference tickets.
<br/>

A huge part of the the industry is networking, and attending conferences.
<br/>

It's how relationships are made. It's a way to display your interests. It's
a way to learn.
<br/>

If you are a student or an underrepresented person who is trying to break in
to the tech industry, contact people in the <a href="#pledging">Pledging</a>
section.
<br/>

<h3>Making a difference</h3>
The problem with conferences. The people who attend already work in tech and
have companies pay for their tickets.
<br/>

Conference tickets can be expensive and it's a barrier of entry. Not everyone
can afford a day off of work and an expensive conference ticket.
<br/>

Let's make conferences accessible to everyone.
<br/>

<h3>Long term goal</h3>
Conferences should have dedicated ticket blocks for students and people who
are underrepresented in tech that they give away.
